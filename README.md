# datelib
Golang package offering a few convenience functions for manipulating dates and cycles

Dates, particularly when dealing with spreadsheets, end up being bucketed into cycles. 
Cycles can be weeks, months, half-yearly or yearly cycles (quarterly too, but not supported yet).

This package allows calling code to get back some sane (Western) date ranges.
